# med-to-dev

## Synopsis

This is my personal path as a recently graduate student with a Bachelors in Exercise Biology who had the next decade or so planned out to eventually become a physician. This student stumbled across a website you may have heard of called Codecademy and was hooked on this activity that perhaps you may enjoy yourself if you are reading this, called 'coding'. This repository documents this student journey from med student to 'dev'. I know there are many repositories like this and my advice to you as you start this journey of becoming a developer regardless of what your background is to stay curious and never stop learning. I hope this repo is able to provide resources that will help you in your journey to becoming a developer. 

## Motivation

I had no computer background prior to starting with Codecademy. After graduation I was curious to learn more about this 'mysterious' thing that I'd heard about. During my breaks studying for the MCAT I found myself on Codecademy and found myself reading about the latest technologies and there was a question that coming up "How does [TECHNOLOGY] work?" and it was this curiosity that led me to pursing a career in Software Development.
